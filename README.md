Clock hands rotation mathematical calculation:

/****** Hour hand rotation *********/
Total angle: 360deg
In 12 hours, angle made = 360deg
In 1 hour, angle made will be = 30deg
Therefore, in x hours = 30x deg + 0.5m deg

also, in 1 hour i.e. 60 mins angle made = 30 degree
so, in 1 min = 30/60 = 0.5deg
therefore, in m mins = 0.5m deg

/*********** Minute Hand rotation **************/
60 min = 360 deg
1 min = 360/60 = 6deg
m min = 6m

/************* Second hand rotation ******************8
60 sec = 360deg
1 sec = 360/60 = 6deg
s secs = 6s deg
